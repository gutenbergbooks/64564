  <h2 class='c004'>A TALE OF TWO MONKEYS.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c005'>The late Dr. John Torrey, of Columbia
College, was extremely fond of pets,
and expressed admiration for the pretty
little Brazilian monkeys with gentle, human
faces and velvety, mouse-colored
coats. A gentleman who heard it went
shortly afterward to Brazil. Upon his return,
he presented the doctor with a choice
pair. A cage was provided for them, and
they soon became members of the family,
petted by all, and tenderly loved by the
doctor, in whose study they lived.</p>

<p class='c006'>One Sunday, the entire family went to
church and the monkeys were left at home
in their cage. When the churchgoers returned
they found the stay-at-homes on
the top of the folding doors of the parlors,
trembling and crying piteously—and for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>reasons, as they soon discovered. The
little mischief-makers had forced open the
door of their cage, and, finding themselves
free, had proceeded to enjoy themselves in
a manner that was scandalous.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/illus006.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>In the cellar a bag of hops and ten baskets
of strawberries were dumped together
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>and hopelessly mixed; the pans of milk
were without cream, and there was unmistakable
evidence that the monkeys had
skimmed them with their tails! A cistern
in the yard offered a fine opening, and the
little mischiefs gathered some clothes from
the line, the cook’s aprons from the kitchen,
and plumped them all in.</p>

<p class='c006'>An open watch belonging to a daughter
of the house attracted one of the monkeys.
He removed the hands, took it down stairs
and carefully covered the face with mud,
and then brought it back and placed it on
her bed. Not so carefully did they pull
the cover from her writing table, bringing
ink and papers with it, and spilling the
ink; and when it came to the pulling down
of muslin curtains and bed hangings, and
tearing them into strips, the fun must have
risen to frenzy, for they proceeded to do
up the parlor window draperies in the
same style. The dining room table next
engaged their attention, and the fact that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>they made a salad of the flowers in the
center with the pepper, salt, and mustard
may have accounted for their tearful state
when they were found perched above the
door.</p>

<p class='c006'>The little penitents were forgiven, for
they seemed really sorry. But soon afterward
one of the midgets carefully removed
the glasses from the doctor’s spectacles,
twisted the bows and put them in the
stove, from which they both took ashes
and sprinkled round the room. Fortunately
there was no fire in the stove, for
the next thing in order was the discovery
of a gross of matches, which they scattered
over the floor.</p>

<p class='c006'>This began to look like danger, so the
doctor was obliged to sell them to Mr.
Barnum. But, whenever he went to visit
them, as he often did, they greeted him
with unmistakable signs of delight and
affection.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>THE OLDEST CHRISTMAS STORY.</h2>
</div>

<div  class='figleft id003'>
<img src='images/illus009.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c005'>What is the most
beautiful Christmas
story in the world?
It is found in the gospels
of Matthew and
Luke. Matthew tells
the story of the wise
men and the star, and Luke of the shepherds
and the angels; and Luke’s story is
the longest, but together they make the
most wonderful story that ever was written.
It is a great truth, so great that we
cannot learn it all, and the heart of that
truth is love. God our Father is a great
Spirit, filling the earth and heavens, and
we, his children, are spirits made in his
likeness, living in earthly bodies, and he
has made all things that are. When his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>children were forgetting their Father, and
losing their likeness to him, he so loved
them that he said, “I will
go down and live among
them, and teach them how
to live and how to love.”
So he began to live just as
we all begin to live in this
world, by being a helpless
little child. He was
first loved by Mary, the mother, and then
Joseph and the shepherds, and the wise
men all adored him.</p>

<div  class='figleft id003'>
<img src='images/illus010a.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<div  class='figright id003'>
<img src='images/illus010b.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>As he grew up many
wondered at his words,
and loved him so much
that they left all to follow
him. At last he laid
down his life for us all.
Then his children began
to understand who he was
and how he loved them, and many gladly
suffered and died for his sake, and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>story of the holy Child is now read by
those who love him around the whole
world, and they now
begin to understand
his words when he
said, “I and my Father
are one.” Is not
this the most beautiful
Christmas story in
the world?</p>

<div  class='figright id003'>
<img src='images/illus011.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>And the hero of this great Christmas
story still lives in heaven, and hears our
prayers and watches over us so lovingly.
He is glad when we are like him and
grieved when we forget his teachings.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>
  <h2 class='c004'>THE ELEPHANT’S TOOTHACHE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c005'>A dentist tells this story of an elephant
that belonged to a circus. He
was very good-natured, but one day when
his keeper went near him he made a vicious
switch at him with his trunk.</p>

<p class='c006'>The keeper knew the elephant so well
that he said at once that the elephant was
sick; something was the matter with him.
He sat at a safe distance from the elephant
and watched him.</p>

<p class='c006'>The elephant trumpeted loud and acted
as though he was very angry, but no one
could decide what was the cause of the
change in this good elephant’s disposition.
This continued for three days. At the
end of that time one of the men said,
“Why, when Jack” (that was the elephant’s
name) “lies down he keeps rubbing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>one side of his head; I think he has got
the toothache;” and everybody immediately
said, “Yes, that’s what’s the matter.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id004'>
<img src='images/illus013.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>The elephant was chained safely to
posts and iron rings, so that he could not
move, and the dentist was sent for. The
dentist looked in his mouth and saw that
one tooth was badly decayed. He touched
it, and the elephant trumpeted as though
in great pain; then the dentist went to
work and filled the tooth.</p>

<p class='c006'>After a time the elephant seemed to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>understand that the dentist was trying to
do something for his pain, and he gave
every evidence of appreciating the attention.
Some weeks later the dentist visited
the winter quarters of the elephant and
the elephant recognized him. It was rather
an expensive operation, for it cost one
hundred dollars to fill that one tooth.
Doubtless, then, the elephant’s toothache
is a larger ache than either you or I ever
know when our teeth ache.</p>

<p class='c006'>There is an old story, something like
this, about a lion which showed gratitude
to a man who had taken a thorn out of his
foot. Do you remember it?</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c005'>These little animals are called ant-bears,
though no respectable father
bear or mother bear would own for a cub
such a queer, sharp-nosed, bushy-tailed
creature as this. The ant-bear hasn’t a
tooth in his head, and any little Goldilocks
might eat his porridge, sit in his chair, and
lie in his bed as long as she pleased without
being afraid of him. The Creator has
given to the ant-bear a taste for insects—he
prefers ants—and has fitted him with a
long and prying snout. Out of his mouth
he can dart a very long, threadlike tongue,
which is so sticky that the ant which it
touches is caught fast and must go down
the red lane, whether he will or not.</p>

<p class='c006'>There are various kinds of ant-eating
birds and animals on the globe, in feathers,
fur, and scales, but this ant-bear lives in
the New World only. Can you tell in
what part of it we should look for him?</p>

      <div class='line'>And all the village, old and young,</div>
      <div class='line'>Had trooped to the church when the church bell rung.</div>
      <div class='line'>The windows were open, and breezes sweet</div>

      <div class='line'>Even the birds in the pale-leaved birch</div>
      <div class='line'>Sang as softly as if in church!</div>
      <div class='line'>Right in the midst of the minister’s prayer</div>
      <div class='line'>There came a knock at the door. “Who’s there,</div>
      <div class='line'>I wonder?” the gray-haired sexton thought,</div>
      <div class='line'>As his careful ear the tapping caught.</div>
      <div class='line'>Rap, rap, rap, rap—a louder sound.</div>
      <div class='line'>The boys on the back seats turned around.</div>
      <div class='line'>What could it mean? for never before</div>

  <h2 class='c004'>“LITTLE PETER.”</h2>
</div>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c005'>The sailors call this bird “Little Peter”
because he is always trying to walk
on the sea. Strangely enough, he does not
care to live on the land, or even very near
it. He even tucks his head under his
wing and goes to sleep with a wave for a
cradle. He is a feather ball, so oily that
the water cannot wet him, and so light that
he cannot sink. The petrel is sometimes
called “Mother Carey’s Chicken,” and follows
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>the ships to get the bits of food that
are thrown overboard. He is very fond of
fat, and so he follows the whaling ships for
the bits of “blubber” that are thrown overboard.
They get very fat themselves, and
the people of the Faröe Islands catch
them to make candles of them. Think of
it! They draw a wick through the fat
little body and hang them up in their huts
to give light at night. Poor “Little Peter!”</p>

<p class='c006'>If you think that it is strange to use a
bird for a candle, what do you think of the
Indians of Alaska who take a greasy little
fish and run a wick through and use that
to light their little huts. Those who have
seen the candlefish and smelled him burning
prefer the electric light.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>A BRAVE LITTLE GIRL.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c005'>There is a story, in a beautiful book
called <cite>The Queens of England</cite>, about
a little girl who saved her father’s life. It
happened a long time ago, when a
woman named Mary was queen. Lord
Preston, the father of the little girl, loved
King James, who had been sent out of
England, and wanted him to be king
again. So there was a trial, and they said
he must die. While the trial was going on
the little Lady Catherine, only nine years
old, was left in the queen’s room in Windsor
Castle. The next day after the trial
the queen found the little girl in a picture
gallery, looking earnestly at the picture of
King James which hung there. “Why do
you look at my father’s picture so
strangely?” asked the queen.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>“I was thinking,” said the child, “how
hard it is that my father must die for loving
yours.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>

<p class='c006'>The queen was so touched by the reply
that she pardoned Lord Preston and gave
him back to his loving little daughter, to
the great joy of both.</p>

<div>
  <h2 class='c004'>A STORY ABOUT A STARLING.</h2>
</div>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c005'>A starling had been taught to answer
certain questions, so that a dialogue
like this could be carried on:</p>

<p class='c006'>“Who are you?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’m Joe.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Where are you from?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“From Pimlico.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Who’s your master?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“The barber.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“What brought you here?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Bad company.”</p>

<p>A picture of the Jewish Tabernacle which the Israelites had instead of a church. It was made of skins and beautiful cloth—purple and fine linen—and could be folded together and carried about from place to place during the forty years in which the Israelites were wandering in the wilderness.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>Now it came to pass one day that the
starling got out of his cage and flew away
to enjoy his liberty. The barber was
troubled. Joe was the life of the shop;
many a customer came because he had
heard of the bird, and the barber saw his
custom falling off. Then, too, he loved
the bird, which had proved so apt a pupil.
But all efforts to find the stray bird were
in vain.</p>

<p class='c006'>Meanwhile Joe had been enjoying life
on his own account. A few days passed
very pleasantly, and then, alas! he fell into
the snare of a fowler, in truth.</p>

<p class='c006'>A man lived a few miles from the barber’s
house who made the snaring of birds
his business. Some of the birds he stuffed
and sold. Others, again, were sold to the
hotels near by, to be served up to guests.</p>

<p class='c006'>Much to his surprise Joe found himself
one day in the fowler’s net, in company
with a large number of birds as frightened
as himself. The fowler began drawing
out the birds one after another, and wringing
their necks. Joe saw that his turn
was coming, and something must be done.
It was clear that the fowler would not ask
questions, so Joe piped out, “I’m Joe!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Are you?” said the astonished fowler.
“What brings you here?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Bad company,” said Joe, promptly.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is needless to say Joe was soon given
back to his master.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>ORIGIN OF THE NAME PUSSY.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c005'>Did you ever think why we call the cat
“puss?” A great many years ago
the people of Egypt, who have many idol
gods, worshiped the cat. They thought
she was like the moon, because she was
more active at night, and because her eyes
changed, just as the moon changes, which
is sometimes full and sometimes only a little
bright crescent, or half moon, as we say.
Did you ever notice your pussy’s eyes to
see how they change? So these people
made an idol with the cat’s head, and
named it Pasht, the same name they gave
to the moon; for the word means “the
face of the moon.” That word has been
changed to “pas,” or “pus,” and has come
at last to be “puss,” the name which almost
everyone gives to the cat. Puss and pussycat
are pet names for kitty everywhere.
Whoever thought of it as given to her
thousands of years ago, and that then people
bowed down and prayed to her?</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c005'>Patsy Bryan was a little street peddler.
Patsy was always ragged, often
hungry, yet kept a brave heart and wore a
happy look.</p>

<p class='c006'>His father was dead, his mother drank,
and Patsy’s scanty earnings went a long
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>way toward maintaining the family, which
consisted of his mother, himself, a younger
sister, and a cripple brother. Poor Patsy
had never been to church or Sunday
school, and was little better than a heathen.</p>

<p class='c006'>One Sunday afternoon, however, Patsy
strayed by a large building in which a
mission Sunday school was in session, and
hearing the singing, he stepped in to see
what was going on. He was kindly invited
to enter a class, and soon found himself
quite at home amid a number of boys of
his own age.</p>

<p class='c006'>After that Patsy became a regular attendant,
and when, in the summer time, a
company of children were sent into the
country for a few weeks by the benevolence
known as the Fresh-Air Fund, Patsy found
himself one of the fortunate number.</p>

and to gather fruits and flowers without
the fear of the ever-present “cop,” and
then what royal fare—vegetables fresh from
the gardens, plenty of nice, fresh milk, berries,
and fruit without any stint! The days
flew by only too swiftly, and soon Patsy
returned to the great city and his daily
work. But he returned with a new color
in his cheeks and with new ideas and hopes
in his mind, and there is every prospect
that, keeping good company and refraining
from bad habits, he will grow into a
useful and happy man.</p>

beautiful corn. Prince knew what to do.
He pulled the mother pig’s ear until she

her safely in. “Where is little
Piggie-Wig?” said Jamie; “he is out too.”
They found him in Prince’s kennel fast
asleep. Prince soon hustled him out, and
Piggie-Wig sat down upon the garden walk
to rest. Jamie threw himself down before
him to have a little talk with him. Piggie-Wig
opened his pink eyes and lifted his
funny nose and looked at Jamie.</p>

“boys are sometimes lazy—you like to pull
weeds, though, and I don’t.” Piggie-Wig
grunted again.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>TWO PAIRS OF FETTERS.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c005'>Eighty years ago a fierce war was
waged in India between the English
and Tippoo Sahib. On one occasion several
English officers were taken prisoners.
Among them was one named Baird. One
day a native officer brought in fetters to
be put on each of the prisoners, the
wounded not excepted. Baird had been
severely wounded, and was suffering from
pain and weakness.</p>

<p class='c006'>A gray-haired officer said to the native
official, “You will not think of putting
chains upon that wounded man?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“There are just as many pairs of fetters
as there are captives,” was the answer,
“and every pair must be worn.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Then,” said the noble officer, “<i>put two
pairs on me</i>; I will wear his as well as my
own.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>This was done. Strange to say, Baird
lived to gain his freedom—lived to take
the city—but his noble friend died in
prison.</p>

<p class='c006'>A noble act—to bear a heavy burden
for another which that other could not
bear for himself. Thus our Saviour showed
his love for the world. “When we were
yet without strength, in due time Christ
died for the ungodly” (Rom. v, 6).</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p>The Century Plant.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c005'>The century plant, as we call it, though
it does not live much longer than fifty
years, is a kind of cactus. The cactus
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>family—or the “cacti,” for we never say
cactuses—numbers fully forty members,
and you are pretty sure to find them growing
in those parts of the far south where
the sun and sand dry up every other green
thing.</p>

<p class='c006'>The true century plant, or agave, is
found chiefly in Mexico. It is composed
of a clump of thick and fleshy leaves, each
having a hard, sharp, thorny point at its
extremity, as well as an edging of prickly
spines growing the whole length of the leaf.</p>

<p class='c006'>At the flowering time a tough, tall stem
grows from the center of the plant, rising
to the height of ten or fifteen feet, and
producing a blossom of a yellowish-green
color.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is said that the century plant has
been put to no less than one hundred uses.
For example, the fiber of the plant is spun
into thread and made into garments; the
thick, fleshy leaves produce an extract
which is used as a substitute for soap;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>while the tough flowering stem, when withered,
serves the purpose of a razor strop.
The pointed thorns at the tip of each great
leaf are used by the natives as needles, and
the leaves themselves are made into shingles.
It seems possible to make paper out
of almost any substance, and this plant is
not an exception.</p>

<p class='c006'>Just at the time when this juicy, pulpy
plant begins to flower the flower-bearing
stem is cut off, together with the thick
leaves immediately around it. A basinlike
hollow is made in the center, into which
all the rich sap or juice flows. A single
plant will, for two or three months, produce
at the rate of two gallons of this fluid
each day. It is collected in vessels of raw-hide,
and kept until it ferments. Many
Mexicans get drunk on this “pulque.” The
city of Mexico contains eight hundred and
twenty shops in which this beverage is
sold. Eighty thousand gallons are consumed
daily throughout Mexico.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c005'>“Mrs. Wells, here is your little turkey,
and it is dead,” said a pitiful
voice. Little Eddie, the ministers son,
who was Mrs. Wells’s next-door neighbor,
held the limp turkey in his hand as he
stood in the door.</p>

<p class='c006'>“O, I’m so sorry,” said kind Mrs. Wells,
and Edward went home with a troubled
face. Something hurt him so.</p>

<p class='c006'>“What is the matter with my little
boy?” said Eddie’s mother. “All the sunshine
has gone out of his face.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Eddie gave a deep sigh; then he looked
up. “I’m going to tell you all about it,
mamma,” he said; “you know Mrs. Wells’s
dear little chickies and turk-a-lurks?
They looked so cunning that I just picked
up one little turkey and hugged it a little
bit, and it was dead. The old mother turkey
was ’most crazy. I carried the poor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>little turkey chick to Mrs. Wells and told
her it was dead, and—and something hurts
me so right in here,” and he clasped his
little hands over his heart.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Was that all you told Mrs. Wells, Eddie?”
asked his mother, gravely.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id004'>
<img src='images/illus054.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>“Yes’m,” said Eddie; but a little later
she saw him trudging toward Mrs. Wells’s
door. “I killed your turkey, I squeezed it
so hard. Will you please to forgive me?”
said little Eddie.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Wells said, “Yes, dear; you didn’t
mean to kill it, I know.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>When Eddie came home the sunshine
was in his face again. “I told her the
whole truth, mamma, and the hurt is gone,”
he said, gleefully.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c005'>There is nothing which will make a
man angry so quickly as to be told that
he is not a gentleman. But one becomes a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>true gentleman by beginning early to practice
gentle deeds.</p>

<p class='c006'>On a crowded trolley car going out of
Boston, one evening, an old woman was
packed in the crowd in the narrow aisle
where the standing room was all taken. She
was bent with age and was very feeble.
Her shabby dress and worn shawl told of
her poverty. She carried a large basket,
and it seemed to grow heavier and heavier
as she changed it from one arm to the
other. Seated where this woman was
standing sat two persons—one whose tailor-made
clothes of expensive fabric showed
he was a well-to-do man. The other was
a ragged newsboy. Tired from his work,
the little fellow’s head now and then
dropped on his shoulder and his weary
eyelids closed.</p>

<p class='c006'>Awaking from one of these naps, he saw
standing near him the shabby old woman
with her heavy basket, and he put his little
hand out on hers and said, very gently, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>manfully: “You must be tired. Take my
seat. I’ll hold your basket.”</p>

<p class='c006'>There was the making of a splendid
gentleman in that boy.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>THE BROTHERS.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c005'>There was a time when the world was
very young, and the first people were
like children who cannot understand how
to worship God, so they were allowed to
offer sacrifices upon an altar. You have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>heard about Cain and Abel, the two sons
of Adam and Eve. One was gentle and
good, and he kept the flocks. The other,
the elder, took care of the ground and the
fruit trees. When they came to offer their
sacrifices Abel brought a lamb and Cain
brought grain and fruit. The Lord looked
upon the hearts of Cain and Abel, and he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>saw true worship in Abel’s heart, but in the
heart of Cain he saw selfishness and sin.
So he did not accept his offering. Then
the sin in Cain’s heart rose into his tongue
as he talked angrily with his brother, and
by and by it crept out into his hand, and
he struck his brother and killed him. The
seed of murder, which is hate, had sprung
up quickly in Cain’s heart.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>HIS WORK.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c005'>One time a man came to one of the
men who worked for him, gave him a
big stone, and said, “Now cut in this stone
leaves just like the ones in this picture.”
The stone did not look very pretty, and the
man said, “I will do just the very best I
can, but I wish I could cut in this beautiful
marble here.” So he toiled away with his
sharp tools, and, after much work, he finished
the leaves according to the pattern.</p>

<p class='c006'>When he finished this the master brought
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>him another just like it, and told him to
cut a branch in it. So for weeks he worked
on these big, rough stones, and he did not
know what they were for.</p>

<p class='c006'>One day, when he was walking down
town in the large city, he saw a beautiful
building. He went over to look at it, and
there, in front of that large building, were
all those big, rough stones upon which he
had been working for so long; but they
were all put together now to form a most
beautiful picture. The man looked at it
a long time and then said: “O how glad I
am I did it well! Now I see what the
master meant.”</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
